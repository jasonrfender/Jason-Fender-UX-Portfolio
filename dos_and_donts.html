                <h2>Have packages sent to front desk</h2>
                <p>It's best practice to have any packages sent to your residence while abroad to location where they can be received
                  without you having to sign for them on the spot. These locations could be a front desk at a hotel, a P.O. Box or a mailbox.

                <h2>Accept packages sent to your room</h2>
                <p>It is unwise to except a package in a location that you are unfamiliar with your surroundings. 
                  You also don't want to except any packages that show up unexpectedly This could be a ruse that is used to conduct a robbery or worse, a kidnapping. </p>

                <h1>Do</h1>
                <h2>Randomize your commute</h2>
                <p>Randomizing your commute is always a wise security practice when traveling abroad, do your best to take alternative routes to your location.
                   Do your best to not set patterns whether you are walking, biking or driving to your location. 
                   Another pattern to be aware of is your dining habits, try to rotate your time and location where you are eating out at. </p>

              <div class="flip-card-back-dosanddonts">
                <h1>Don't</h1>
                <h2>Set patterns</h2>
                <p>Don't take the same route to your location everyday. This is a good way for someone to observe a pattern that could be used 
                  to conduct nefarious activities against you. The same goes for the times and places you go when you're abroad, don't consistently go to
                  the same restaurant at the same time everyday because this could easily be observed and used for negative reasons.

                <h2>Travel in numbers</h2>                
                <p>Always do your best to travel in numbers while abroad. At a minimum, at least travel in pairs. You make yourself a 
                  harder target for bad actors when you're not alone. If a bad actor was observing your movements, they would be a lot less 
                  likely to try to take advantage of someone that they knew wasn't going to be by themselves.

                <h2>Travel by yourself</h2>
                <p>Don't travel by yourself because this can make you a target of oppurtunity. If you have to travel by yourself, always have a plan 
                  in place for how you will get from point A to point B. Give someone your itinerary so that they are aware of your timeliine and organize 
                  check-ins if necessary.  </p>

                <h1>Do</h1>
                <h2>Talk about the local soccer/football team</h2>
                <p>This is a very generalized topic to talk about. But if all other small talk fails, talking about a local soccer/football team 
                  where you're traveling abroad is always a safe topic. Talking about other popular sports, music, food or even theatre is good topics to focus 
                  on when making small talk with locals.

                <h1>Don't</h1>
                <h2>Talk about politics</h2>
                <p>This is the golden rule even when traveling within the US, so when you're traveling abroad it's best to 
                  practice this rule as your number one rule. Talking about politics in a foreign country can be a recipe for 
                  disaster and it's a subject that should be avoided at all cost.

                <h2>Know the local laws to the best of your ability</h2>
                <p>It's a good practice to familiarize yourself with some of the local laws before you arrive in 
                  the area that you're traveling to. Although some of the local laws may seem odd compared to what
                  you are used to back home, it is best to follow them so you can avoid interactions with the local 
                  authorites.

                <h2>Assume the law will be the same as they are back home</h2>
                <p>Never assume that what you can get away with back home will be the same when you're traveling abroad.
                  For instance in Europe jaywalking is not conducted and is usually always enforced. Traffic laws while driving 
                  in another country can be almost polar opposites than what they are in the US. Speed cameras are heavily used
                  and the fines can be extreme to say the least.

                <h2>Explore and have fun</h2>
                <p>This is of course a given, when traveling abroad you should always do your best to enjoy yourself and 
                  have as much fun as possible. This is of course have as much fun as possible, but within reason. Always use your
                  best judgement when it comes to pushing the limits of what people consider fun and what some people might consider 
                  wreckless.

                <h2>Visit places that could be restricted to visitors</h2>
                <p>Always do your best to be familiar with any areas that may be off limits to people and might 
                  especially restricted to out of country visitors. It is not uncommon for countries outside the US to have
                  what is called black listed or restricted zones. It's best to be aware of these areas and avoid them at all cost.
