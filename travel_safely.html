                <p>Before traveling it is always best to have a plan when it comes to what-if scenarios 
                  that require one. If there is a natural disaster what do you do, where do you go? If you 
                  have to evacuate the country, how will you do so? With Covid being a serious health issue
                  currently. What happens if you catch Covid and have to quarantine in place?
                  These are all descent what-if scenarios that you should have a rough plan for.

              <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>A good travel app is always a valuable tool have on your smartphone. If you can get one that works 
                  offline that's even better, although that can be a tall order to fill. This will allow you to use the 
                  app in a country that might not have the most reliable cell phone network. If you have the money to pay 
                  for a travel app that gives you location specific information and realtime updates, this can be extremely
                  valuable informatino when traveling abroad.

              <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>As I mentioned in the previous section, the area you are traveling in might not have the best cell phone
                  network. Before you make your trip it is best to know how reliable your smartphone and service will be in 
                  the area you will be visiting. If your service is going to be too unreliable, it is a good idea to buy a local 
                  prepaid flip phone that will get service just about any place you go in the country.

              <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>This topic can be a little difficult to perform without exhausting oneself from
                  constantly being in a state of hightened awareness. But it is always good to know things
                  like where the nearest exit is to your location, where the shelter inplace location is for 
                  natural disasters and even where civil unrest or politcal rallies may be held that day near 
                  your location. You should also know where the closest US embassy or consulate is to your location.
                  If you are in a country that doesn't have either of these, it is best to know where the nearest emabassy/consulate
                  is that can help you or communicate with the US on your behalf. Some examples of these countries are Canada and Switzerland.
                  These examples are just a few things that you can take into consideration 
                  and are a drop in the bucket when it comes to being area of your surroundings.

              <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>This is a topic that is always going to be broad in nature. You can spend days and nights doing research on an area 
                  that you're getting ready to travel to. Somethings I always look at when I'm traveling is the health conditions of the 
                  area, should I drink the local tap water, what do I look for when dining out. What is the crime like in the area I'll
                  be visiting, what is the most common crime perpetrated against tourist? Take pickpocketing for instance, the tactics that
                  some petty theifs use in one country might not be used in the next. So how you will protect youself from these tactics
                  will vary.

              <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>Do your best to carry various forms of currency that can be used in the area you're traveling in.
                  It's possible that credit cards may not be accepted everywhere you go, so it's best to have cash as a 
                  backup for your credit card. It is also a good idea to be aware of the fine print when withdrawing money
                  from local ATMs, some machines can detect a debit card that is out of country and will change the fees 
                  and raise the dollar amounts that can be withdrawn.

              <div class="flip-card-back">
                <p>The idea of inspecting your vehicle can vary by your location and is purely a suggestion. You 
                  will want to start by making sure that you vehicle is still locker and that nothing has been tampered
                  with, like the gas cap cover and the trunk. You'll also want to inspect the vehicle to make sure nothing
                  was slide under it or attached to it. Here in the US human traffickers were using a number of zipties 
                  to keep a unknowing bystander from being able to get into their care. While they were distracted by trying
                  to get the zipties off the door handle, a vehicle would come in behind them and people would job out 
                  in order to grab them and quickly throw them in the vehicle and drive off without anybody seeing anything.

                <p>Learning about the culture before you travel to a location outside the US is very important. You will want to learn the Do's/Don'ts
                  of a specific culture. In some cultures this is disrespectful to make direct eye contact with the men and even women in some cases.
                  It can be sign of disrespect to show the bottom of your shoes in others. It's always good to learn as much about the culture
                  before and during your trip, it will make things a lot easier when you get to your location and you'll be much more enlightened 
                  when you get to experience the culture first hand.

                <p>If at all possible do your best to safeguard your valuables, especially your passport. 
                  If your hotel room or the place you are staying at has a safe that is reliable this is always going 
                  to be a good place to store your valuables. If you don't have access to something like this, it is always good to keep a 
                  good lock on hand when you travel because a lot place have closets with a latch that can be locked. If neither of these 
                  options are available then the next best option for securing your valuables will be with a travel wallet/pouch that can be 
                  stored/hidden on yourself.
